## First homework description 


  In this first assignment, I was tasked with changing div's to semantic tags. the majority of the changes made had a primary goal of simplifying the .html and the CSS code.


## content
 .html- changed most tags to semantic tags to be easier to see what applies where.
 CSS- combined CSS with similar effects to shorten the amount of code within the CSS.
