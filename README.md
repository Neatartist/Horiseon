# Horiseon

## First homework description 


  In this first assignment, I was tasked with changing div's to semantic tags. the majority of the changes made had a primary goal of simplifying the .html and the CSS code.


## content
 .html- changed most tags to semantic tags to be easier to see what applies where. Tags changed for example were div to header, article, and article1. I combined CSS with similar effects to shorten the amount of code within the CSS. Based on the changes to the tags in the html, I changed the CSS code to reflect those changes. After each change, I refreshed the page to see what the effects were and made the corrections when needed.
